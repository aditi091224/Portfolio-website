# Portfolio-website

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio website! This repository contains the code and assets for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my data analysis projects, skills, and experiences.

## About Me

I'm a passionate data analyst with a strong background in statistical analysis, programming, and data visualization. I thrive on solving complex problems using data-driven insights and am dedicated to continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of data science.

## Portfolio Highlights

- **Project 1: Loan Prediction System using machine learning**
  - Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, are used to build predictive models. These models analyze historical data, identifying     
    patterns and relationships among various borrower attributes and their likelihood of loan default.
  - Data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are utilized to create visual representations of data trends and patterns.

- **Project 2: Digit Recognition**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks are specialized deep learning architectures designed for image recognition tasks. They consist of layers that automatically learn features and patterns from pixel-level data.
  - It includes tools for image preprocessing, manipulation, and feature extraction. In digit recognition, OpenCV can be used to preprocess images, perform edge detection, and isolate individual digits.

- **Project 3: Shark Tank data analysis using SQL**
  - Leveraging SQL queries, the Shark Tank dataset is dissected to unveil insights into investment trends, successful pitches, and entrepreneur dynamics, enabling data-driven assessments of investor preferences and overall ecosystem performance.
